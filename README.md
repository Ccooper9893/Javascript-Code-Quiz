# Javascript-Code-Quiz

## Description
A timed code quiz asking questions about Javascript. Answer the questions wrong, lose time. When the quiz is finished enter your initials to save your high-score. This challenge has helped me learn the use of HTML DOM API. This includes DOM traversing, event listeners, timers intervals, and localStorage capabilities.
